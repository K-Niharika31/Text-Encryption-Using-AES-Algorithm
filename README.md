# Text-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is one of the most common and 
widely used symmetric block cipher algorithm. This algorithm has its own 
structure to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data and is applied in hardware and 
software all over the world. It is extremely difficult for hackers to get the real data 
when we encrypt using the AES algorithm. To date, there is no evidence to crack 
this algorithm. AES has the ability to deal with three different key sizes such as 
AES 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, and each of these ciphers has a 128-bit block 
size. In this project, a text message is given as an input to the AES encryption 
algorithm which gives an encrypted output.
